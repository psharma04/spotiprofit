                    <div class="content-inner">
                        <p>GPT-3 is what's known as a neural 
network-powered language model. A language model is basically just a 
program that can calculate the likelihood that a random set of words is a 
valid statement. For example, given the choice between "I took my dog to 
the park" and "I took my house to the park", it would be able to determine 
that the first option is a more correct statement.</p>
                        <p>GPT-3 was trained on a massive library of data, 
including the entirety of the English Language Wikipedia and <a 
href="https://commoncrawl.org/">CommonCrawl</a>. Words and sentences were 
randomly removed from the content of passages, and the language model 
needed to fill them in correctly based on the surrounding content.</p>
                        <p>This is basically a comprehension exam for 
primary school students, but instead of 40 questions, it's effectively the 
entirety of human knowledge being tested on. As a result, the final model 
is able to accurately generate text in all sorts of fields, not just one 
specific area.</p>
                        <p>GPT-3 is a <i>transformer-based neural 
network</i>, which means it looks at each word or phrase and determines 
its significance in a sentence. For example, in the sentence "I took my 
dog to the park", the words "dog" and "park" are probably the most 
important, followed by "I" and "took", with the rest of the sentence being 
essentially context clues. Transformers are able to take in an entire 
sentence or paragraph at once, rather than processing one word at a time. 
GPT actually stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer!</p>
                        <p>A lot of really cool stuff is possible as a 
result of the generalised nature of GPT-3. I've used it in the past as a 
grammar corrector, an English to French translator, a text summariser, and 
have even written entire assignments for school using it (Fun fact: GPT-3 
can pass HSC English Advanced!). Other people have used it for more useful 
things, such as swearing filters, imitating famous poets, and coding 
entire projects using under 10 lines of instructions, something which 
would have been impossible a few years ago.</p>
